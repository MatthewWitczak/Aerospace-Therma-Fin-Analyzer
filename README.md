# Aerospace-Therma-Fin-Analyzer
The application is a 1D thermal analysis tool for cooling fins. It numerically solves the steady-state heat conduction equation with convection along a fin, using a finite-difference method. The solver computes the temperature distribution along the fin and visualizes it as a plot.
